Introduction

Hello, and welcome to my Commander Keen FAQ.  I hope that by the time you 
finish reading this, you will have a vast knowledge of Commander Keen, his 
universe, and a few cold, hard facts, without starting to foam at the mouth and 
babble senseless phrases (except, perhaps, Shikadi).  If you are prepared, read 
on brave soldier.

[1.1] General Disclaimer and Legal Stuff
	I AM NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF 3D Realms ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, APOGEE

GLORY, C) CREDIT IS GIVEN TO ME, THE AUTHOR, D) IT IS THE MOST CURRENT VERSION

GONADS. BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY STILL READING, YOU'VE GOT WAY TOO MUCH 
TIME ON YOUR HANDS, AND THERE'S WAY MORE INTERESTING STUFF TO READ.  GET GOING!

[1.2] Who am I?
	My name is Dave Allen, known to most of the Internet community as 
Flaose (flay-oase).  I'm Canadian, that's all you need to know.  But enough 
about me, how are you?

[1.3] Why am I writing this?
	I am writing this for two reasons: 1) The official Commander Keen FAQ 
by Bill Amon was okay, but it wasn't very comprehensive, I think a FAQ should 
be the only thing you need to find out about a certain subject (e.g. Commander 
Keen).  2) I don't think I've made a great enough contribution to the Commander 
Keen society, but this is it, The 
Big One.

[1.4] Who made the Commander Keen games?
	As far as I know, the people who worked on the Commander Keen games are 
the Programmers, John Carmack, John Romero, and Jason Blochowiak, Adrian 
Carmack (he's not related to John, really!), doing the Artwork. Creative 
Director Tom Hall, whom all other Creative Directors fear because of all his 
great ideas, Jay Wilbur, the CEO dude, and Bobby Prince, the guy who composed 
the music for Commander Keens 4 - 6.

[1.5] Wasn't there another Commander Keen FAQ?
	Yes, the Official Commander Keen FAQ was from a guy named Bill Amon.  
Refer to section [1.3] Why am I writing this for more details.

[1.6] Will there be more Commander Keen games?
	I'll quote 3D Realms' Web Dude, Joe Siegler on this one, `If you played 
Keen 5, there was a screen that said something to the effect of "Join us in 
December 1992 for the greatest Keen adventure yet".  There was a picture of 
Keen smiling, with a Santa Claus hat on. At the time, id Software was intending 
to do a third series of Commander Keen, tentatively entitled "Commander Keen: 
The Universe is Toast".  However, other projects came up (Wolfenstein 3D, Spear 
of Destiny, and later, Doom).  There are no plans now to do more Keen. The main 
reason for this is that id Software owns the rights to Commander Keen, and any 
new project would have to be either done by them directly (EXTREMELY 
unlikely), or at least approved by them. At this time, there are no Keen games 
under development by Apogee, id, or Monkeystone (where Tom Hall & John Romero 
now work as of 2001).  If and when there ever is more Keen, it will be state of 
the art of whatever technology is current at the time.  In December of 1998, 
Tom Hall has stated his interest in making future games based on his character 
Keen and his universe, but only if he owned the rights to Keen, which is also 
unlikely.'  Also, don't bug id Software about giving the license away, it'll 
just make them more possessive, and they won't give it up, and we'll never have 
any more Commander Keen Games, and it'll be All Your Fault!  So don't do it, 
okay? Since the last version of this FAQ, a new Keen game was released, simply 
called 'Commander Keen', this mediocre game was released for the Gameboy Color.  
Tom Hall, the creator of Keen, had nothing to do with it.  It was developed by 
David A. Palmer 
Productions.

[1.7] Why play Commander Keen?
	Commander Keen is an in depth and complex side-scrolling game (well, 
that first part might be stretching the truth), in which you control a cute 
little eight year old through dozens of levels, to finally complete your goal.  
After every game, the plot thickens a little more.  It's also a very fast game; 
literally, it runs at around 40 frames per second, compare that to the original 
Quake.  It is also a tense experience, one hit to keen, and he's dead.  
Hilarity is everywhere, usually encoded, but still there.  What are you waiting 
for?  Head over to Cerebral Cortex 314 page at 
http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/, and download shareware!

[1.8] Where can I get Commander Keen?
	You can order Episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 directly from 3D Realms at 
their website, http://www.3drealms.com/, by phoning 1-800-GAME123, or by 
mailing to Apogee Software Productions P.O. Box 476389 Garland, TX  75047-6389.  
You can get Keen Dreams from Softdisk Publishing.  Episode 6 is only available 
from id Software, when you buy the id Anthology (Discontinued), which includes 
all the works of id Software, up to Quake.  Please only download Commander Keen 
episodes 1, and 4, and the Demos of episode 6 and Keen Dreams (available at 
Cerebral Cortex 314, http://www.classicgaming.com/cc314/), since only they are 
part of the Shareware concept.  Speaking of which...

[1.9] What is Shareware?
	Originally, the term shareware described a full-blown software product 
that relied on user's honesty (and pocketbooks) to support the author.  
Understandably, most shareware was a commercial failure; why register when you 
have the full product already.  Knowing this, Scott Miller came up with a new 
shareware strategy to market his game 'Kingdom of Kroz' ('I have this cunning 
plan' he said / as he lay upon his bed): He would release an 'episode' of the 
game to the unsuspecting gaming public.  If the consumer liked the game, they 
could pay a fee to register it, and receive the remaining 'episodes' and 
therefore more excellent gameplay.  It was a 'try before you buy' system, if 
you will.  Needless to say, Kroz was a commercial success, and it 
revolutionized the shareware industry.  This became known as the 'Apogee 
Model', and was the precursor to the playable demos that are regularly released 
by gaming companies these days to entice players to purchase their games.

[1.10] What's up with id, 3D Realms and Monkeystone?
	id Software was the company who developed Commander Keen, Apogee 
Software, now known as 3D Realms, published it.  However, they had a falling 
out around the time of DOOM, id Software said Apogee wasn't serious enough 
about their business.  Monkeystone is the company that Tom Hall, the creator of 
Commander Keen, and John Romero, a programmer of the Commander Keen series, 
work for.  id, Apogee, and Monkeystone are related in no other business way.

[1.11] Can I contact Apogee/3D Realms for hints?
	You can ask for hints, if you have registered the games!  Hints can be 
received by phoning (972) 278-5655, Monday through Friday, between 8:00am and 
6:00pm CST, or by writing to Apogee Software at P.O. Box 496389, Garland, TX 
75049-6389.

[1.12] A note on Pirating
	Arr me maties.  With pirating ye are squandering it all.  

[1.12.1] What is Pirating?
	Pirating is the unlawful breaking of the copyright of a game, by giving 
away, or selling it without removing the original copy from your computer.  So 
say I just got Commander Keen 3, and I give it to my friend, than my friend 
gives it to three of his friends, who each give it to three of their friends, 
and so on and so on.  In the end, 3D Realms will have lost perhaps thousands of 
dollars.  Now imagine if everyone does it.  Companies will have to start laying 
off workers, which means crap games that take years to complete.  Eventually, 
the industry will be no more, and we wouldn't want that, would we?

[1.12.2] What I've accidentally pirated a game?
	Hey, it happens.  However, make sure you buy the game promptly from the 
store or company.  Your conscience will be clear, and your favorite game 
company will still be able make more great games.  Hey, everybody wins!

[1.12.3] Is there anywhere I can report pirating? 
	Of course!  You can phone the Software Pirating Association (SPA) at 1-
800-338-PIR8, or 3D Realms at 1-800-3D Realms.

[2] Commander Keen's Universe (Also Known as The Meat)
------------------------------------------------------

Commander Keen's universe is also our universe, everything that is in his 
universe is in our universe, and everything that happens in his universe 
happens in our universe.  Watch the skies.

[2.1] Who or what is Commander Keen?
	Commander Keen is the alter-ego of eight year old Billy Blaze.  When 
Billy dons his brothers' football helmet, he becomes COMMANDER KEEN!  Defender 
of Earth with an iron fist.
 
[2.2] What games has Commander Keen starred in?
	In addition to the seven Commander Keen games, Commander Keen has made 
cameo appearances in:  The super-secret level of Doom II (level 32), in a 
message in Pickle Wars (it originally was planned to be an Apogee game).  He is 
also found as a hostage in Bio-menace, in a puzzle in Paganitzu, and Commander 
Keen's helmet is found in a level of Crystal Caves.  Someone named only as B. 
Blaze is mentioned in the Epic Games classic side-scroller game Jill of the 
Jungle.

[2.3] Who are Commander Keen's friends?
	Unfortunately, Commander Keen has very few friends in his universe 
(that would suck, wouldn't it?), but here they are:

[2.3.1] Marooned on Mars
	The Yorps: These lovable, one-eyed green Martians are friendly.  Very 
friendly.  Too friendly.
	
	Butler "Tin Can" Robots: A nice little Martian robot that has trouble 
keeping his hat on.  He is nice except for the fact that he usually pushes you 
off a platform to your death.

[2.3.2] The Earth Explodes
	Youths: These young Vorticons were sent into space by the Grand 
Intellect to grow into fierce warriors.  They like to tear around and don't 
much care what gets in their way.  These youngsters will most likely grow up to 
be Vorticon Elite.
	
	Vorticon Elders:  Wise Elders are kept in stasis in the living quarters 
of the ship.  They are from what is known as the Before Time, before the Grand 
Intellect.
	
	Scrubs: These little red robots perform various menial duties around 
the ship and can walk on almost any surface.

[2.3.3] Keen must Die!
	Youths: The same spoiled brats that knocked you out in the second 
episode.  Now they play a deadly game of jacks.
	
	Foobs: These little yellow creatures like to go out for strolls, 
whistling, and enjoy the day.  Unfortunately, they are completely afraid of 
almost everything.  If you touch them, they will grow so tense that they will 
pop.
	
	Messie: The great sea serpent of the legendary Loch Mess.  Who knows if 
she even exists?

[2.3.4] Keen Dreams
	Carrot Couriers: These couriers are in a hurry!  Get out of the way or 
you might be pushed between a rock and a hard place!

	Pea Pods: They may look scary, but these guys are harmless.  Just watch 
out for their offspring, the Pea Brains!

	Mosquitoes: Though annoying to most people, these mosquitoes don't seem 
to bother Commander Keen.  The blue ones might even be helpful somehow.

	Children: Other children captured by Boobus Tubers' Dream Machine.  
They just sit and wave to our hero as he passes by.

[2.3.5] Secret of the Oracle
	Bounder: These red, friendly, bouncing guys can be annoying, but they 
can be helpful, too!

	Council Member: These are the Gnosticenes you are trying to rescue.  
There are eight of them hidden in the depths of the Shadowlands.  

	Inchworm: These placid yellow creatures are all over.  Watch out where 
you step or they'll be afoot!

	Princess Lindsey: The Princess is here to help you out.  If you can 
find her, she will give you valuable information that will help you complete 
your quest. 

	Schoolfish: These fish are the real follow-the-leader types.

[2.3.6] The Armageddon Machine
	Korath III Inhabitant: The denizens of the planet below the Omegamatic, 
these guys are just trying to go on with their day.  Unfortunately, the Shikadi 
are making it very difficult. 
 
[2.3.7] Aliens ate my Babysitter!
	Flect: These fellows have big teeth, but their bite isn't the problem!  
Watch where you shoot when these guys are around.
	
	Blooglet: Baby Bloogs come in four colors: red, yellow, green, and 
blue.  They aren't very dangerous, and they might even prove helpful sometimes.

	Molly: The object of your quest.  The Bloogs are holding Molly for 
dinner.

	Viva: These are probably the most common form of life on Fribbulus Xax.  
Vivas have a wonderful quality-touching them improves your health.  In fact, 
for every 100 you come into contact with, you'll gain another life.  Watch 
carefully for Queen Vivas-touching one will give you another life all by 
itself. 

[2.4] Who are Commander Keen's enemies?
	Most of the aliens Commander Keen meets are mean, and hate him, and 
want him dead.  Here's the lowdown.

[2.4.1] Marooned on Mars
	Gargs: These wild-eyed, teeth-gritting Martian monsters are angry at 
you, angry at themselves, angry at dirt, angry at clouds, just plain angry.  If 
Freud were to see them, he would call them the "Id".
	
	Vorticons: The Vorticons on Mars are members of a Mars outpost and are 
really on the bottom rung of the Vorticon social ladder.  Being on an outpost 
has made them kind of tough.  In the second two episodes, they are known as 
"Grunts".
	
	Tank Robots: These robots exist to kill any intruders.  Even friendly 
ones.

	Pat-Pat: These enormous shelled enemies open and shut their mouths so 
quickly, if Commander Keen gets too close, he'll be bit right in half! 

[2.4.2] The Earth Explodes
	Grunts: These are the Vorticons from Episode One, but they have led a 
more posh lifestyle, so they are weaker.
	
	Vorticon Elite: These are Elite warriors.  To show their loyalty to the 
Grand Intellect, they had their ears clipped.  They are mean and like to shoot 
a lot.  They wear blue and purple suits.
	
	Guard Robots: These awful purple robots are basically hovering machine 
guns.

[2.4.3] Keen must Die!
	Grunts: here they are again, with red suits.
	
	Vorticon Women: They are very dangerous.  They have big claws and 
breathe fire.  You've come a long way, baby.
	
	Meeps: A race of green, egg-shaped, horrendously bad singers with 
sorely misplaced operatic intentions.  They think they are the greatest singers 
in the world.  They are wrong.

	VortiNinja: These are the most deadly enemy in this episode. Not only 
do they move and jump around very fast, they can also kick you! And to top it 
all off, they take 4 shots to kill.
	
	The Grand Intellect: His scary picture is framed on the wall of various 
Vorticon homes and schools.  Who is he?  Finish the game and find out!

[2.4.4] Keen Dreams
	Frenchy: The french-fry tossing Frenchy is very dangerous.  Watch out!

	Tater Trooper: The most common inhabitants of Tuberia, these bayonet 
carrying spuds almost always seem to be around. 
	
	Pea Brain: The offspring of the Pea Pods look cute enough, but don't be 
fooled by that sweet face!  They're pure evil! 

	Squash: The squash (appropriately) try to squish Commander Keen when he 
walks nearby.

	Sour Grapes: These poor grapes are so sour at life, they'll fall off 
the vine whenever Commander Keen steps beneath them! 

	Rotten Apple: These apples are rotten to the core!  Be warned that they 
can climb poles too!

	Boobus Tuber:  The King of Tuberia, this guy is huge.  Seriously huge.  
He can jump as good, or better than you, so watch out!

	Killer Tomatoes: The mad tomatoes of Tuberia will try to eat you whole!

	Broccolash: Packing 125 lbs. of hair, Commander Keen better watch out 
where he steps to avoid being crushed!

	Spearing Asparagus: These dangerous vegetables run towards Commander 
Keen with their large, spiky forehead!

	Seeded Watermelon: Watch out for the black seeds shot from these fed up 
watermelons!  They always seem to be in the most inconvenient places.   

[2.4.5] Secret of the Oracle
	Arachnut: Insane, green, crab-like walking creatures with two dangerous 
mouths!

	Berkeloid: This fiery fella is not to be toyed with.  He throws big 
fireballs!

	Dopefish: The second dumbest creatures in the universe, this creatures 
thought patterns go "swim swim hungry, swim swim hungry."  They'll eat anything 
alive and moving near them, though they prefer heroes.

	Gnosticene Ancient: These guys like to take your items and disappear.

	Lick: These blue beanbag-like monsters breathe a deadly lick of fire.

	Mad Mushroom: Dangerous plants that hop and are deadly to the touch.

	Mimrocks: Little creatures that look exactly like rocks, until your 
back is turned!

	Poison Slug: The most common inhabitants of the Shadowlands, poison 
slugs mean trouble twice - once if you touch them, twice if you should land in 
the puddles of poison they leave behind.

	Skypest: Virtually immune to your shots, these guys really are pests.  
There must be someway to get them, though.

	Sprite: Dopefish won't mess with these problematic underwater 
creatures: they shoot energy blasts at you!

	Wormouth: Watch out for these green menaces.  They're a lot bigger than 
they look.

	Blue Eagle: These invulnerable eagles are only temporarily stunned by 
Commander Keen's Neural Stunner, not completely knocked out.  In a few seconds 
they will get up and chase after Commander Keen. Don't break their eggs!  A new 
blue eagle will be born! 

[2.4.6] The Armageddon Machine
	Sparky: This guy has a magnetic personality.  His presence is 
electrifying.  You'll be shocked when you see him!  Watch out when he 
"charges!"

	Little Ampton: This purple fellow slides up and down poles and works on 
his computer terminals.  Don't be on the pole he's on, `cause he slides up and 
down quickly!

	Slicestar: The slicestar is a crystalline being with razor-sharp 
points.  Don't get near `em!

	Volte-face: Volte-faces are crazy, insane floating creatures that have 
electronic arcs for hair!
	
	Robo Red: Robo Red is a nasty guard.  If he hears a sound, he shoots 
first and asks questions later.  Avoid, avoid, avoid!

	Shelley: This tiny darling seams pleasant enough until you least expect 
it, then she goes all to pieces!

	Spirogrip: The spirogrip spins and launches toward walls.  If you're in 
the way, you'll be toast!

	Shikadi Mine: Woe be the hero that wanders near one of these.  They 
will follow you until you are close enough, then they explode!

	Spindred: Spindred slam angrily at the floor and ceiling.  They'll 
crush you quicker...than something quick.

	Shikadi: These energy beings built the Omegamatic and plan to destroy 
the galaxy.  Watch out for them near poles.

	Sphereful: Frightful plasma orbs with orbiting diamond sensors, tread 
carefully by these dangerous denizens. 

	Shockshund: Three-legged energy dogs of the Shikadi, their spark is 
worse than their bite!

	Shikadi Master: The most frightful foe aboard the Omegamatic, they cast 
Electrospheres at you and teleport around.  Very dangerous.

[2.4.7] Aliens ate my Babysitter!
	Bloog: The Bloogs stole your babysitter.  These one-eyed green 
carnivores are driven by their hunger across the galaxy.

	Bip: Bips are the cogs in the Bloog's machine.  They run platforms, 
they patrol areas in their Bipships, and generally cause havoc.  They will 
fight for anyone, but they happened to hook up with the Bloogs.

	Babobba: This little red fellow is a baby Bobba.  Babobbas are not 
quite as tough as full-grown Bobbas.

	Blorb: These red gelatin-like beings are deadly but slow.  They bounce 
around and make you nervous.

	Gik: This hard-shelled customer's worst points are its points!  Its 
legs are spikes, so it will flip and try to poke you.

	Ceilick: These purple beings hid in holes in the ceiling and will try 
to get you with their forked tongues.

	Blooguard: These burly Bloogs have big clubs to bonk their enemies.  
Even if they miss, their clubs shake the ground so violently you might get 
knocked out!

	Bobba: Bobbas are nasty indestructible beings that hop and fire deadly 
energy bolts from their eyes.

	Nospike: These blue fellows walk around until they find something to 
charge at.  But even charging, their favorite pastime, will bore them after a 
bit.  Watch out for their fearsome horn!

	Orbatrix: These big blue eyeballs will bounce and spin at you!  Be 
careful, they float and follow you.
 
	Fleex: The Fleex are amongst the finest engineers in the universe, 
having designed all of the buildings and devices on Fribbulus Xax.  
Unfortunately, the Bloogs built them, devastating the sleek and elegant 
designs.  The Fleex have very sensitive eyes (a natural 
consequence of spending a lifetime in a basement lab), so sensitive that they 
have to wear dark shades when they're out in the light (making them nearly 
blind).  To compensate, they've developed an oversized ear which allows them to 
hear other creatures as they move around.

[2.5] What are the worlds Commander Keen visits?
	Keen visits quite a few planets on his journeys, here are the planets 
he's visited lately.  

	Mars: Probably the planet everyone of Earth is most familiar with, this 
is where Commander Keen starts his legacy.  He visits both the polar ice caps 
and the dark side of Mars.  Commander Keen gets marooned when the Vorticons 
steal necessary parts of the bean-with-bacon Megarocket.

	Vorticon VI: A strange heavenly body, it is the home planet of the 
Vorticons.  It is very similar to Earth, with the exception of the great 
fortresses created by their ruler, the mysterious Grand Intellect and the 
Vorticons.  Commander Keen must find the Grand Intellect and stop his plans to 
destroy Earth!

	Tuberia: Kingdom of Boobus Tuber, the evil Dream Machine sends children 
into captivity when they say something negative about vegetables.  Keen must 
destroy it or he'll be sleeping forever!

	Gnosticus IV: Home planet of the Poison Slugs, Ancients and Council 
Members.  The evil Shikadi have imprisoned the invulnerable Council members in 
deep warrens of this forbidden place.  Keen must rescue them or he'll have to 
say Goodbye Galaxy!

	Fribbulus Xax: Home of the evil Bloogs, Commander Keen must face 
incredible horrors and impossible odds to save his babysitter Molly.  If he 
doesn't save her before his parents get home, Billy will have to tell them, 
"Aliens ate my babysitter."

[2.6] How does Commander Keen get around?
	Commander Keen travels from planet to planet and from ship to ship 
using his interstellar starship made from old soup cans, rubber cement, and 
plastic tubing.  The Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket!  While exploring other worlds 
and ships, Commander Keen can use the Holy Pogo Stick he found on his excursion 
on Mars.  Unfortunately, Commander Keen leaves his pogo stick behind when he is 
sent to Tuberia with the Dream Machine.

*[2.8] What's the name of Keen's pet yorp?
	At the end of Marooned on Mars, Commander Keen brings home a yorp to 
keep as a pet (see section [9.1]).  There has, however, been some confusion 
about his name.  Some feel that his name is Norp the Yorp.  Others feel that 
his name is Spot (as his food bowl suggests).  Tom Hall was asked to set the 
record straight:

'It's Spot, really. Billy was probably trying to give his parents something 
normal to hold onto since they let him keep a one-eyed alien as a pet. :)'

And the matter is laid to rest.


*[2.9] What's this I hear about Billy Blaze's extended family?
	You may have heard that Billy Blaze, a.k.a. Commander Keen, is related 
to B. J. Blazkowicz, hero of the Wolfenstein games.  The following is an 
excerpt from the Wolfenstein 3D Official Hint Manual:

	William Joseph Blazkowicz was born August 15, 1911, to Polish
	immigrants.  Blazkowicz was a top spy for the Allied Forces,
	receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor and other accolades
	for heroism.  "B.J.," (as he was called by his friends) married
	after World War II, at age 40, to Julia Marie Peterson.  Their
	son, Arthur Kenneth Blazkowicz, became a television talk show
	personality in Milwaukee.  For show biz purposes, Arthur changed
	his last name to Blaze.  Arthur later married Susan Elizabeth
	McMichaels.  They had one son (which they named after Arthur's
	father), William Joseph Blazkowicz II, or as he signs his grade
	school homework, B. Blaze....
	
*[2.10] What is this 'dopefish'?
	The following is an excerpt from Joe Sigler's awesome Dopefish website 
http://www.dopefish.com:

	What is Dopefish? Dopefish was one of the characters that appeared in 
	Commander Keen, Episode IV back in 1991. That's it. All the rest of 
	this "Dopefish mania" came later. You can read about it...at 
	dopefish.com, the definitive source of info on everyone's favourite 
	fish! 

	Dopefish is the product of the fertile mind of Tom Hall. It was one of 
	24 drawings he did of ideas for characters for Commander Keen: Goodbye, 
	Galaxy! while part of id Software. Dopefish was one of the characters 
	from these drawings that made the cut. According to Tom, "I just drew 
	this stupid little fish," and the rest is history.

	It was pointed out to me recently that the Dopefish can predict the 
	future.  How?   Well, the original Dopefish sketch referenced above was 
	drawn back in 1990.  Dopefish theologists point out that when the 
	Dopefish was called into being by Tom, it made Tom have a foreshadowing 
	of a future id release, Quake.  You want proof?  [On that original 
	sketch, there was a Quake symbol.]  Makes you think, doesn't it?  
	Especially when Tom was no longer with id Software when they began work 
	on Quake.
	
	Dopefish is described in the cast of characters for Secret of the 
	Oracle as the second dumbest creature in the universe. His thought 
	patterns go, "swim swim hungry, swim swim hungry." Dopefish "will eat 
	anything alive and moving near them, though they prefer heroes."  
	(What's the most dumbest creature in the universe? Why, of course, the 
	Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. It's so stupid that it thinks if 
	you can't see it, it can't see you. One way to avoid the BugBlatter 
	Beast is to throw a towel over your head.) Dopefish was adopted" by the 
	Tech Support staff at Apogee soon after I came on board. Then Steve 
	Quarrella came onboard and it balooned from there. Dopefish was my 
	favorite character, and Steve was the resident Keen expert -- Lee 
	provided a few vocal effects and some art. We got hold of some screen 
	capture software and went to town...

So why is Dopefish so popular?  Could it be his simple thought patterns (people 
always feel sorry for stupid animals)?  His bucked-teeth?  His tendency to 
burp?  It beats me.  But it really doesn't matter; everyone loves him.

[3.1] What's the Story Behind Invasion of the Vorticons?
Billy Blaze, eight year-old genius, working diligently in his backyard 
clubhouse has created an interstellar starship from old soup cans, plastic 
cement and rubber tubing.  While his folks are out on the town and the 
babysitter has fallen asleep, Billy travels into his backyard workshop, dons 
his brother's football helmet, and transforms into.

COMMANDER KEEN - Defender of Earth!

	In his ship, the Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket, Keen dispenses galactic 
justice with an Iron Hand!

[3.1.1] What's the Story Behind Marooned on Mars?

home?  Stay tuned!

[3.1.2] What's the Story Behind The Earth Explodes?

city with their deadly Tantalus ray!  Keen must sneak aboard the ship and stop 
each Tantalus team from their terrible task.  If he fails, the Earth Explodes!

or no school.  Hmm...

	After much deliberation, Keen decides to save the Earth anyway.  Don't 
miss an action-packed second of this exiting episode in the Commander Keen 
trilogy!  

[3.1.3] What's the Story Behind Keen must Die!?

landing on the island of Vortiville.  Here he faces mind numbing horrors of 
suburban life.  Then he will travel to New Vorticon, where life is a dark, 
dangerous enterprise.  He will also have to face the violent forces massed in 
the Vorticon military installation.  After this, he will face the impossible 
maze of the Caves of Oblivion.  If he passes this barrier, he will finally 
reach the castle of the Grand Intellect, where all his beliefs and fears come 
together in a titanic, shocking finale!  Don't miss the incredible shattering 
conclusion to the Commander Keen trilogy!

[3.2] What's the Story Behind Keen Dreams?
	We find young Billy discussing matters of paramount importance with his 
mother.

	"I just saved the Earth mom," said Billy.  "I don't have to eat 
vegetables."

	"Sure, dear," said Billy's mom.  "I bet Neil Armstrong never complained 
about HIS mashed potatoes."

	"I bet Neil Armstrong never traveled to Vorticon VI and defeated the 
Grand Intellect, either," Billy mumbled at his plate.  He sat there, legs 
dangling, staring at his offensive, starch-laden foe.

	After a pointed remark about the quality of the mashed potatoes, Billy 
was sent to his room.

	"Stupid Vegetables," he grumbled, his eyelids growing heavy.

	Soon Billy was fast asleep.

	Suddenly he woke up, and his bed was atop a hill.  On either side of 
the bed were giant potatoes wearing metal helmets and holding bayonets.

	"Come with us Captain Keen," said the first.

	"You've been brought here by the dream machine," said the second.

	"Boobus Tuber our king and boss-"

	"-is now your master, come with us!"

	Billy frowned, grabbed his football helmet of his bedpost, and started 
to put it on.

	"First of all, spuds," Billy said pushing down on the helmet.  "That's 
COMMANDER Keen.  Second of all, who do you think you are?"

	"We're Tater Troopers it's plain to see," said the first.

	"So get-"

	Keen reached under his pillow and retrieved his Vorticon Hyperpistol.  
He moved it from "Stun," passed "Disrupt," all the way up to "Fry to delicate 
brown."

	"How about a walk on the fried side boys?" Keen said.

	Two BZZAPs later, Keen pouted.

	"Aw nuts.  My Hyperpistol's empty," he said.

	Just then, a child in chains ran up to him.

	"Keen, oh, Keen, oh, Captain Keen!  Save us from the Dream Machine!" he 
said.

	"That's COMMANDER Keen," the young genius corrected.

	"Whatever.  Save us!" said the child.

	So Billy hopped out of his bed and started on his quest to defeat King 
Boobus Tuber and destroy the Dream Machine!    	

[3.3] What's the Story Behind Goodbye, Galaxy!?

[3.3.1] What's the Story Behind Secret of the Oracle?
	Billy Blaze toils in his backyard workshop, busily constructing his 
latest invention: the Photachyon Transceiver.  Put in simple words, it is an 
instantaneous radio - point to anywhere in the galaxy, and you can pick up a 
signal as if you were right there.  After picking up a lot of bad alien 
sitcoms, Billy hears a strange message, spoken in the language of Omnispeak 
that the Vorticons taught him.
	
	Brrzzz.giggg.oment of great triumph.frzzt.ast the Milky Way will 
be.huzzzzz.terly destroyed.pyuneeeeeeg.can stop us now.  We will remake the 
galaxy in the name of the Gannalech.  Power to our race!  Power to the Shikadi!

	Then the radio is silent.

	"So the Shikadi are planning on destroying the galaxy, huh?" thinks 
Billy to himself.  "Sounds like a job for...COMMANDER KEEN!

	Billy once again dons his brothers football helmet, contemplating three 
questions:

	Who the heck ARE the Shikadi?
	Where are they?
	How are they planning to destroy the galaxy?
	
	Climbing into the Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket's cockpit, Billy sets up 
the launch sequence for Gnosticus IV, the home of the Gnosticenes, guardians of 
the Oracle.  They owe him a favor, and he needs to get some questions answered.  
The launch sequence begins.

	"Suppertime Billy!" announces his mom as she walks out to the workshop.

	"Ah, nuts!" spouts Billy.  He realizes that there's not enough time to 
stop the sequence and cover the ship!  Thinking quickly, he pulls out his 
Neural Stunner, points it at the door, and waits.  One "Zzzzap!" later and his 
mom is frozen in the doorway.

	"Whew," says Keen

	"Honey? What's the matter?" says Billy's dad, coming out the back door.

	"Double Nuts!" mutters Billy.  He peeks past his mom, takes aim and.

	Zap!

	Once at Gnosticus IV, a Council Page runs up to him.

	"Oh Captain Keen!" he begins.

	"That's Commander Keen," corrects Billy.

	"The Shikadi were here, and they kidnapped the Council members and sent 
them to the Shadowlands far to the west."

	"They didn't kill them?" Keen asks.
	
	"Impossible.  They are immortal," says the Page.  "So they just made 
sure they weren't available to activate the Oracle."

	"Well I'll just go get them," Keen says, turning with heroic 
determination.

	"Um, but Captain Keen, they also left a bunch of horrible creatures and 
traps to guard them," says the Council Page.

	"Well, I'll just go get them CAREFULLY, then," Keen says over his 
shoulder.

	Keen turns to walk out the door, stops, turns and addresses the page.

	"And if you call me Captain Keen again, I'm taking you with me."

	Keen boldly heads out the door as the page mutters, "Sorry."

	Commander Keen hops in his Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket and heads for the 
Shadowlands.

[3.3.2] What's the Story Behind The Armageddon Machine?
	Last episode, our hero Billy blasted off in search of the mysterious 
Shikadi, who serve "the Gannalech" and plan to destroy the galaxy!  After a 
short delay, Keen rocketed to Gnosticus IV, only to find the Council Members 
missing!  The Shikadi kidnapped `em!

	Keen flew to the Shadowlands, faced horrible foes, and rescued the 
kidnapped ancients.

	After Keen freed them from their imprisonment, the Immortal Council 
Members activating their source of galactic wisdom, the Oracle.  The Oracle 
informed Keen that the Shikadi had nearly completed a machine to obliterate the 
galaxy!

	This episode finds Keen in stealth mode, sneaking his Bean-with-Bacon 
Megarocket up to the Omegamatic.  Securing his Attach-O-Ray to an exhaust port, 
Keen enters the Omegamatic and begins his most dangerous adventure yet! 

[3.4] What's the Story Behind Aliens ate my Babysitter!?
	In this episode, Billy is out in his clubhouse, busily working on his 
handy new CompuWrist wrist computer.  He hears Molly, his babysitter, calling 
him to supper but he keeps on working.  He hears a strange noise in the 
backyard and decides to investigate.  On a patch of scorched grass he finds a 
note:

	Keen-
	
	Thanks for dinner.
	
	-The Bloogs of Fribbulus Xax.
 
	P.S. Next time get one with more meat, please.

	He puzzles over this for a moment, then notices the babysitter has 
stopped calling.  Suddenly he realizes that aliens are having her over for 
supper-and when they say "for supper" they mean "FOR SUPPER"!  If he doesn't 
save her, his parents will be furious.  They'll never believe that "Aliens ate 
my Babysitter!"

	"This is a job for Commander Keen!" he declares.  Once again, he dons 
his brother's football helmet, hops into the trusty Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket, 
and starts the launch sequence for Fribbulus Xax.  He's got to save Molly from 
becoming a snack for creatures from another planet! 

	It's great arcade action and hilarious fun in the latest episode in the 
Commander Keen saga!

----------
[4] Lyrics
----------

	Like all good songs, the songs in Commander Keen, composed by Bobby 
Prince, have lyrics.  Only the lyrics for two of the songs have ever been 
released, here they are.

[4.1] Eat Your Veggies
	Here's some background.  This song was originally intended for Keen 
Dreams, however Softdisk Publishing (who were publishing this "Special Edition" 
Keen), decided to get rid of music so the program would fit on one floppy disk.  
Anyway, Billy is sitting at the table with his family, refusing to eat dinner.  
It starts with his mom pleading with Billy, here goes.

	"You've got eat your vegetables, eat them right up!  You've got to eat 
your vegetables, tell him Daddy."

	So his Dad tries to convince his son to eat.

	"You've got to eat your vegetables, NOWWWW!"

	Billy's sister, seeing an opportunity to make fun of him start's 
speaking.

	"You've got to eat your vegetables, na-na, na-na, na, na!"

[4.2] Aliens ate my Babysitter!   
	This song starts off right when Billy realizes the Bloogs have stolen 
his babysitter, and he's going to have to save her.

	"Aliens ate my babysitter, ate her right down to her toes, worse, they 
still look hungry, and are trying now to bite off my nose.  My babysitter might 
have deserved it, of that, a Judge I'll not be, but I am a different story, the 
Universe dies without me!"

	Now Keen does some rap and here it is:

	"My name is Keen, a fighting machine, helmet on head (except when in 
bed), a pogo for height, a ray gun for might, the Bacon-'n-Bean's my flying 
machine.

	I never fear whenever I'm near, some critter from space, who's not in 
his place, I'll leave them to feed on whatever they need, I'll fill them with 
lead after they're fed.

	My Mom and my Dad don't know I'm this BAD!  But when my story's told, 
all kids will be bold."

-----------------------------------
[5] The Standard Galactic Alphabet?
-----------------------------------

Unknown to most Earthlings, there is an alphabet standard throughout the 
galaxy: The Standard Galactic Alphabet!  I'm proud to say that I figured out 
the Standard Galactic Alphabet (with the exception of Z), without any hints, 
when I was 8 years old. Using only Commander Keen episodes 1, 4, and 5.  
 	
[5.1] What is the Standard Galactic Alphabet?
	The Standard Galactic Alphabet (SGA) is fairly easy to master.  There 
is no upper and lower case, and the sign ·-· is used to signify the end of a 
sentence (like a period).

	The SGA is used in all the Commander Keen game, with the exception of 
Keen Dreams (it's the kid in the middle, the one who never really fits in).

-------------------------------------------
[6] The Hints, Tips, and Other Funny Things
-------------------------------------------

	Sometimes, we need a little helping hand to get on our way.  Or maybe 
we just want a few pointers, or just want to exploit some bugs and/or see 
things we wouldn't normally see. If you're strange, and not like everyone else, 
skip this.  Thanks goes out to Snortimer for the Commander Keen 3 flying trick, 
Cho'gall for the Maragia disappearing block trick, KeenCommander for the 
hovering Robo Red info, Kong33 for the info on the red flashing hand sign in 
Commander Keen 6, and Dark Hood for the translation of the Morse code message 
in the Bloog Control Center in Commander Keen 6.

[6.1] What are some Hints for Invasion of the Vorticons?
	General Hints: Some places are only reachable by the pogo stick.  It is 
wise to practice your pogo skills.  "The Impossible Pogo Trick" is a trick that 
makes the game easier.  How it works: walk or run in a direction, then press 
the pogo key, release it QUICKLY and press jump.  You will pogo up and over at 
an angle that's not possible using any other method.  In Episodes Two and 
Three, this technique is very valuable.

	All good Commanders know when to save their progress.  On the World 
Map, press F5, and select a save position from 1-9.  You can continue your game 
from the title screen, just select Continue Game, and press the number of your 
previously saved game.
	
	Conserve your ammo!  If you can get past an enemy without firing, do 
it!  You'll find this technique especially helpful in Episode Three, where 
you'll more than likely run out of weapon power if shoot everything that moves.  
Another useful technique is getting your enemies in between you and either a 
Tank Robot, a Guard Robot, or a Vorticon Women.  More often than not, they'll 
get fried in the crossfire.

	You can use your pogo stick to avoid going into the Exit door.  Before 
you start leaving, activate your pogo, and you won't get sucked in.  Use this 
to get goodies behind the exit.

	Read the Signs, they give you invaluable hints (and a whole bunch of 
information you don't need).
	
	Use your common sense!  If it looks sharp, pokey, or otherwise harmful 
to you, it probably is!

	Specific Hints:
[6.1.1] Marooned on Mars
	Hidden Bricks: Look for little white dots, these are the upper-left 
corners of hidden bricks, look out for, and use them!  They lead to many 
secrets.

	The Pogo Stick: After completing the first city, you should go to the 
Pogo Shrine (it's the little grey shrine).  There you'll find, surprise, 
surprise, 'The Holy Pogo Stick'!  Also look for hidden bricks above the Exit 
Door.
	
	The Hidden City: They Hidden City is accessible through the Red Maze 
City (the eastern most city, on the dark side of mars).  At the bottom of the 
maze city (near the yellow key card) is a dark area.  Fall past two fire pits, 
and hold down right.  Next, hop from the hidden brick to the ice cannon area.  
Then get into the ice cannon's line of fire, and finally get launched over and 
go into the teleporter (it'll probably take a few tries).

	DIE!: If there's a sign that says DIE, something nearby will try to 
kill you (no kidding).

	The Tank: Get enemies between you and a Tank Robot, they'll be toast.

	Beating the Vorticons: You can get past all of the Vorticons without 
firing a shot, all it takes is a little practice:
	
	Joystick Guard: Go to the farthest right edge of the ledge below the 
exit (the one with a raygun on it).  The Vorticon will go off the right edge, 
and plummet to his death.
	
	Car Battery Guard: Get him to follow you, and make him jump off the 
platform.  Getting the Car Battery should now be easy as pie.
	
	Vacuum Cleaner Guard: Get the Vorticon to jump on the blue cylinders, 
and run underneath him, through the door.
	
	The Vorticon Commander (Guarding the Everclear): This is REALLY HARD to 
do without cheating, but possible (I've done it before, once).  When he's over 
on the left side of the platform, climb up, and PRAY that he jumps high.  If 
so, run quickly under him and over to the Teddy Bear.  I only recommend you to 
do this if you feel the need to boost your ego.  Otherwise, use a hidden brick 
to jump up on the huge block, and shoot the chain.

	Marooned on Mars: If you can somehow get past the Vorticon Commander 
using the before mentioned method, run into the exit without getting the 
Everclear.  You'll truly be Marooned on Mars (you can't re-enter levels you 
have beaten)!    

[6.1.2] The Earth Explodes
	Pulling Switches: It's undocumented, but important.  To pull switches 
or push buttons, press the pogo button when you are near.
	
	Tantalus Rays: Tantalus Rays are destroyed by using the pogo to hop up, 
and shooting the purple sparking cell in the glass bubble.  WARNING: Don't 
stand to close to the switch when activating your pogo, you could pull it, and 
that ends the game (in a bad way)!

	Scrubs: The little red robots, Scrubs, can be jumped on for a ride up 
the wall.  You'll find this technique VERY useful.
	
	Guards: The Guard Robots are deadly adversaries: Get an enemy between 
you and him.
 
	Vorta-Cola: You can stand on top of Vorta-Cola cans to get to higher 
places, and taking them may change the way the Scrubs walk.

	The Dark: The wise Vorticon will not jump in the dark.  In fact, even 
unwise Vorticons will not jump in darkness.

	The Impossible Pogo Trick: Using "The Impossible Pogo Trick" jump on 
one of the Tantalus levels allows you to get to the top, avoiding all the nasty 
things below.

	Anti-Hero?: Keen can leave Rome's Tantalus Ray still active if he goes 
as far right as possible at the beginning, and hopping up the little hole. 
	
	Someone Failed English: On the world map, the SGA labels Rome and 
Moscow are in the wrong places!  In addition, on the far right side of the 
Paris Tantalus level, FUCL is spelt with the small colored platforms (though 
word is that in some versions the 'L' is a 'K').

[6.1.3] Keen Must Die!
	Simplicity: You need only to complete three levels to finish the game, 
but what's the fun in that?

	Go Up: On the Volcano level, follow the directions on the sign.

	Killer Opera: When Meeps sing, the sound kills, and can travel through 
anything.  Even solid walls!

	VortiNinja: You can usually run under the VortiNinjas when they jump 
high into the air.

	In the Line of Fire: Line up a foe with a Sentry Gun, or a Vorticon 
Woman.  They'll die in a jiffy.

	Up and Down: Remember, some falls are necessary, and some things are 
hidden in the heavens (think big clouds).

	Jacks: Jacks are almost always deadly, don't enter an area with them 
unless you have an Ankh, speaking of which...

	Ankhs: All Ankhs can be obtained.

	Oops!: If you look at the Blue Key in the Status Screen, it has a sky 
blue aura around it.  Weird!

	Fly Without Cheating: It's possible to fly in the air without using a 
cheat.  Just press jump and then fire at almost the same time.  You'll waste a 
few bullets, but it's good for getting to tough places when you don't want to 
cheat.

	The Boss: On the final level, you can stand on the shoulders. (I don't 
want to give away too much, now do I?)

[6.2] What are some Hints for Keen Dreams?
	The Down Jump: You can jump through logs by holding Down, and pressing 
the Jump button.

	Flower Power!: If you miss an enemy you are trying to shoot, you can 
recollect your Flower Power shots for a short period of time (the same is true 
for Boobus Bombs).

	Mosquitoes: You can stand on the Blue Mosquitoes, but not the black 
ones.
	
	Boobus Bombs: If you see the message `Boobus Bombs Near!' when the 
level is loading, find and collect them.  You need at least 12 to defeat King 
Boobus Tuber.

	Quick Ending: If there isn't a cement wall in your way, go against the 
right wall, AND DIE!  If Commander Keen's head goes through the right edge of 
the screen, you'll complete the level (and if you miss, it's your problem).

[6.3] What are some Hints for Goodbye Galaxy!?
	General Hints: Don't use two button firing, it makes it even more 
impossible to do the "Impossible Pogo Trick" (which is done by running, and 
hitting the pogo and jump keys in rapid succession).

	To jump through a hole in the ground, look down and hit the jump key 
(this is known as the "Down Jump").
	
	If you just don't make a jump, you can usually grab the edge and hang 
on (as long as it's not on a diagonal slope).

	You don't have to pull up right away if you grab an edge, take a long 
breather if you want.

	To erase the high scores in Commander Keens 4 and 5, delete the 
CONFIG.CK4 and CONFIG.CK5 files respectively.  You'll also have to reselect any 
changes to joystick or game settings, as this information is also stored in the 
CONFIG files.

	Save the game often, you'll be glad you did.

	If you're having jerky motion problems, or having "snow" fly across 
your screen, select the Fix Jerky Motion and SVGA Compatibility options on the 
Configure - Options screen.
 
	Read the Signs!

Specific Hints:
[6.3.1] Secret of the Oracle
	Hidden Platforms: There are many hidden platforms in Commander Keen 4.  
You can see them flash in the sunlight every few seconds (NOTE: These are 
usually VERY hard to see, but if a flash catches your eye, be sure to look).

	I want to live!: There are seven free keens available on the first 
level.

	Outside the Pyramid: You can get to the top of the Pyramid of the 
Moons.  I'm talking the outside!  And on the subject of Moons...

	Don't Moon Me!: If you stand on a shaded moon in the Pyramid of the 
Moons for a few seconds, Commander Keen will moon you!

	Suck it up Princess: Princess Lindsey appears twice.

	Flashy!: There's stuff hidden very well in Hillville, all you need is a 
flash of insight.

	More Moons!: The way to the Pyramid of the Forbidden is at the bottom 
of the Pyramid of the Moons.  (Remember, the Inchworms will be afoot, but how 
many?)

	Mmm...: The Dopefish likes to eat the small Schoolfish that follow you.

	Faster!  Faster!: The jump button makes you swim faster underwater.

	Splat!: The Skypests can be squashed by jumping on them with your pogo 
stick.

	Mr. Mime!: You can only shoot Mimrocks when they are jumping at you.

	The Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket: If you're running really low on ammo, a 
trip to The Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket may be beneficial.

	Hee Hee!: Mad Mushrooms leap higher on the third bounce.

	Not So Invisible: When you hang on the ledge of the disappearing ice 
blocks in Miragia, you won't fall down...even if it disappears!  So if the 
blocks start disappearing, quickly grab the ledge of one of them and climb onto 
it again when it reappears.

[6.3.2] The Armageddon Machine  
	Let there be Life: There are NINE lives available in the first level 
(but don't expect them to be easy to find).

	Egotism: The names of the two level designers, John Romero the Software 
Engineer, and Creative Director Tom Hall, are hidden in two of the levels.

	Naughty Tom!: The enemy name 'Little Hampton' is actually far dirtier 
than it would first seem.  Tom Hall says this:

'Some British TV show referred to a guy with a... um, small... you know... as 
having a "Little Hampton". That stuck in my head when I was naming stuff, I 
guess.'

	The Swastika: In Version 1.0 of The Armageddon Machine, in the Energy 
Flow Systems, there is a Swastika above John Romero's name.  However (probably 
due to public outcry), it was removed by Version 1.4.  This must be set 
straight!  Here's what Romero himself had to say about the incident:

'Obviously, it was a reference to Wolfenstein... ? Sure, Keen 5 was created 
before Wolfy, but we knew that was our next project.'

Tom Hall, creator of Commander Keen, further expanded on that point:

'I think John put that in as a reference to Wolfenstein, not to imply anything 
about any character's ideology.  Same as when he originally had the swastika 
shape in DOOM, that folks go so upset about that took it out.  As if that meant 
anything remotely like condoning the atrocities of Hitler.  (Remember kids, 
Hitler bad.  Hating groups of people for no reason, very bad.  Killing people 
for the same no reason, very very very insanely bad.)

If Wolfenstein had had a logo, like a big "W" or something, then John would've 
made that shape, I'm sure.'

	Points!: There are 30 000 hidden points near the start of Defense 
Tunnel Sorra.

	The QED: You can't destroy the Quantum Explosion Dynamo directly, 
you'll have to find something (or someone) to destroy it for you.

	I'm Flying!: It's possible to make Robo Red hover off the end of a 
platform.  I'll leave it up to you to figure out though...

	Korath III: The way to the secret level is through the Gravitational 
Damping Hub, look down and translate.

	The REAL Ending: To see the real ending of Commander Keen 5, you have 
to do something on the Korath III Base.

	It's just that Easy: There are problems on Korath III if you're playing 
in the "Easy" difficulty level.  In earlier versions of Commander Keen 5, after 
a few seconds of play in the secret level, the game would quit and you would 
get the error message `Goplat moved to a bad spot: 2114,1600'.  In Version 1.4, 
it isn't possible to see the "Real Ending" because, well, you'll have to find 
out for yourself.  

	Fuses: You probably figured this out, but you break the fuses by using 
your pogo stick.

	Duck!: You can duck the nearly invincible Slicestars and the rather 
vincible Volte-Faces, but not Robo Red.  He's too big and evil!!! 

	More on Robo Red: You can stand next to Robo Red and not get shot (you 
can sometimes duck them too), but then you're next to him and that can't be 
good.

	Sentries: You can stand on the horizontal Sentry Guns to get to higher 
places.

	Slicestar: The Slicestars can be destroyed!  The ones moving on a set 
path take 20 shots to be destroyed, but the Slicestars that just bounce around 
take 45 shots to destroy, and are hardly worth the time, energy, and ammo since 
they're easier to avoid then their slow moving counterparts.

	Even More on Robo Red: Robo Red's hearing is very good, and if he hears 
a noise, he'll shoot first, and ask questions later.

*[6.4] What are some Hints for Aliens ate my Babysitter!?
	Many Secrets: There's more to do at The Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket than 
it seems (notice that you can't exit the level on the right side).

	Important Items: There are three very important items that Commander 
Keen needs to get to complete his quest.  They are located in The First Dome of 
Darkness, Bloogfoods, Inc., and Bloogton Tower.

	The Secret Level: The way to the Blooglab Space Station is through the 
Bloog Control Center (and I mean THROUGH it).

	The SGA: The entire Standard Galactic Alphabet is hidden in the 
Blooglab Space Station.

	Blooglets: You should feel no remorse for wasting a Blooglet.  They 
like to hang on to their corresponding Gem Key Color.

	Sentries: Like in Commander Keen 5, you can stand on top of the Sentry 
Guns (just watch out for their shots).

	I'm Falling For You!: If you can get Nospike to charge off a cliff, 
he'll fall to his death.  It's almost too easy!

	Ceilicks: Watch out for a little tip of a tongue, it's a Ceilick hidden 
up in the rafters!  If you find yourself underneath one, shoot up immediately 
(any later, and you'll be dead already).

	Blooguards: Jump up as a Blooguard swings his club in the air, you 
won't be stunned by the shock wave.

	The Hand: Some levels have areas with a red flashing hand sign.  This 
indicates a dangerous area that isn't necessary to enter to complete the level.

	Code Cracker: In the Bloog Control Center you can hear this Morse code 
playing in the background: SOS SOS DE KEEN SOS SOS K.

	High Score: If you use the Warp Cheat and go to the High Score screen, 
you get the message: Keen is in the High Score screen.  Call Id!  What could 
this mean?  Who knows?

	Patience: This game is quite hard!  Patience and ingenuity is the key.

	The Other Key: The KEY to success in the Blooglab Space Station is to 
FALL in love with Molly because she's DROP-dead gorgeous.  Rescue her quickly, 
before she DECENDS to the stomach of a Bloog (it seems I'm beating around the 
bush here).

	Read the signs!

	Code                	Description
      	KEEN6 /TEDLEVEL ??  	This is a level practice mode that gives you 
				infinite lives, type it at the DOS prompt.

[8] The Maps
--------------------

Woe be the Gamer who needs to consult this to complete one of the Commander 
Keen Games.  If you are one of these Gamers who needs this section, TOO BAD!  
Even I have a sanity level: you'll have to settle with the World Map from Keen 
Dreams.

[8.4] What's the Layout of Keen Dreams?

	Okay, it's not a work of art, but you get the idea.  Look forward to 
more maps in forthcoming versions.

---------------
[9] The Endings
---------------

	The Endings!  I strongly suggest you actually experience the endings of 
each of the Commander Keen games for yourself, just having the words isn't the 
same.  Read on, not much more to go!

[9.1] What's the Ending to Marooned on Mars?
	Commander Keen returns to the Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket and quickly 
replaces the missing parts.  He must get home before his parents do!

	Keen makes it home and rushes to beat his parents upstairs.

	Shh, honey.let's see if little Billy is asleep.

	Billy.? are you A-WHAT IS THIS ONE-EYED GREEN THING IN YOUR ROOM!!!!???

	Ah, Mom, can't I keep him?

	We'll talk about it in the morning, son, you get some rest.

	OK Mom.  Goodnight.

	Goodnight, dear.

	But there is no sleep for Commander Keen!  The Vorticon Mothership 
looms above, ready to destroy Earth!

	To be Continued.

[9.2] What's the Ending to The Earth Explodes?
	After disabling the weaponry of the Vorticon Mothership, Billy heads 
for Earth.  Even great space-heroes need a nap after defeating a vicious horde 
of violence-bent aliens!

	The Vorticon ship limps back to Vorticon VI to tell of their defeat at 
the hands of Commander Keen.  The Grand Intellect will not be pleased.

	Wake up, Billy.  It snowed last night!  There's no school!

	Wonderful, Mother.  That will give me time to rid the Galaxy of the 
Vorticon menace and discover the secret of the mysterious Grand Intellect!

	Ok, hun, but you'd better a nourishing vitamin fortified bowl of Sugar 
Stoopies first.    

	Ok Mom.

	To be continued.

[9.3] What's the Ending to Keen must Die!?
	No.  It can't be!  Mortimer McMire!!!  

	Mortimer has been a thorn in your side for as long as you can remember.  
Your IQ test score was 314-Mortimer's was 315.  He always held that over you, 
never letting you forget for one day.

	All the practical jokes, the mental cruelty, the swirlies-each memory 
makes your teeth grit harder.  And now he's out to destroy  Earth!  You have 
had enough!

	"Alright Mortimer, what's the problem?  Why destroy Earth?"

	"You and all those mental wimps deserve to die!  I'm the smartest 
person in the galaxy.  Aren't I Mister THREE FOURTEEN!  Ah, ha, ha!"

	"I'll get you for that, Mortimer!"

	"Come and try!  You'll never get past my hideous Mangling Machine!  
Prepare to die, Commander Clown!"

	<Commander Keen then promptly destroys the Mangling Machine>

	With Mortimer McMire out of the picture, and his brain-wave belts no 
longer controlling them, the Vorticons are free from their mental enslavement.

	"Commander Keen, in honor of your meritorious service in freeing us 
from the Grand Intellect's mental chains, I and the other Vorticons you haven't 
slaughtered want to award you The Big V, our highest honor."

	"Thank You!"

	The End. For now!

[9.4] What's the Ending to Keen Dreams?        
	Yes!  Boobus Tuber's hash-brown-like remains rained down from the skies 
as Commander Keen walked up to the Dream Machine.  He analyzed all the complex 
controls and readouts on it, then pulled down a huge red lever marked "On/Off 
Switch."  The machine clanked and rattled, then went silent.  He had freed all 
the children from their vegetable-enforced slavery!  Everything around Keen 
wobbled in a disconcerting manner, his eyelids grew heavy, and he fell asleep.

	Billy woke up, looking around the room, the early morning sun shining 
in his face.  Nothing.  No vegetables to be seen.  Was it all just a dream?

	Billy's mom entered the room.

	"Good morning, dear.  I heard some news on TV that you'd be interested 
in," she said, sitting by him on the bed.

	"What news?" Billy asked, still groggy.

	"The President declared today National `I hate Broccoli' Day.  He said 
kids are allowed to pick one vegetable today, and they don't have to eat it."

	"Aw, mom, I'm not afraid of any stupid vegetables," Billy said.  "But 
if it's okay with you, I'd rather not have any french fries for awhile."

	THE END

[9.5] What's the Ending to Secret of the Oracle?	
	Wow, this is really an impressive way to activate this monolith of 
ancient wisdom.

	click

	Everyone be silent.  The oracle is about to speak.  Hmmm.  Maybe it's 
got a dead battery or something.

	The Shikadi are a race of shadow beings from the far side of the 
galaxy.  They are building an Armageddon Machine and are planning to blow up 
the galaxy with it, then rebuild it to suit their needs.  They live on the 
third planet of the Korath system, which is 71, 000 light-years from Gnosticus 
IV.  The Armageddon Machine is almost complete.  And this is what they look 
like.

	<Commander Keen makes a number of horrified faces>

	These Shikadi are toast!  Thanks for the scoop, Oracle.  I'm outta 
here.  I hope it doesn't rain on my folks..

	Meanwhile, back on Earth.

	<Lightning Strikes>

	To be continued. 

[9.6] What's the Ending to The Armageddon Machine?
	CONGRATULATIONS

	You have completed "Goodbye, Galaxy!"  Commander Keen has saved the day 
once again!

	But things are still in motion..

	With their Quantum Explosion Dynamo in ruins, the Shikadi rush to their 
getaway ship and hightail it back to their own galaxy.  *Due to a freak fuse 
malfunction, they cannot take off and are arrested by the Korath III Police for 
double-parking.
	
	Keen rummages through the control room of the QED for clues as to why 
the Shikadi wanted to blow up the galaxy.  He stumbles upon a note written in 
the Standard Galactic Alphabet.

	DEAR BILLY
	YOU FELL FOR MY ANDROID
	DUPLICATE PLOY IN THE MANGLING
	MACHINE AND NOW YOUVE FALLEN
	FOR IT AGAIN
	IM BLOWING UP THE UNIVERSE NOT 
	THE STUPID GALAXY
	THIS WAS JUST A BIG DISTRACTION
	DODO
	TAG YOURE IT
			MORTIMER
	PS GANNALECH IS HOW THESE DUMB
	SHIKADI PRONOUNCE GRAND
	INTELLECT
	OR DIDNT YOU NOTICE THAT MISTER
	THREE FOURTEEN

	Keen takes the note with him to decipher on the long space voyage home, 
not seeing anything else of interest..

	<The camera zooms into a football helmet with "MM" on it>

	Back at home after having saved the galaxy, Billy feeds his rain-soaked 
parents ice cream and gently shakes them back to consciousness.  Hopefully, 
this won't affect his allowance.

	See you Christmas '92 when Commander Keen returns to battle for the 
universe!  It'll be the biggest Keen ever!  You won't believe your eyes!

	Thanks for playing!

	* When you do something special in the Korath III Base, this sentence 
is added. 

[9.7] What's the Ending to Aliens ate my Babysitter!?
	"Gee, thanks Billy," said Molly.  "Boy, my brother is gonna get in 
trouble for this."

	"Your brother?" Keen asked.  Molly is the older sister of his former 
nemesis, Mortimer McMire.  But he was caught in the explosion of his Mangling 
Machine...wasn't he?  Could he be alive?  "But he's. he's."

	"He's in trouble is what he is.  He told the Bloogs to take me hostage.  
In exchange, he told them where to find the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella 
IV."

	"Yeah, I've seen it," Keen said.  So, Mortimer's back eh? thought Keen.  
"Where IS Mortimer?"

	"Oh," said Molly.  "He said something about blowing up the entire 
universe or something.  Well, let's get back before your folks get home."

	"Yeah, we'd better-THE UNIVERSE?!" Keen said.  "Yikes!"

	See you next time, when Commander Keen and Mortimer McMire battle for 
the universe!

	Thanks for playing!

*[10] The End of it All
-----------------------

	It's been a strange journey returning to, and updating, this FAQ.  The 
original version was written over three and a half years ago.  Since then, my 
writing style has completely changed.  Comparing original sections to updated 
sections, you'll probably notice a huge clash in the way it's written.  I've 
completely changed too.  I said things in this FAQ that I'd never dare write 
these days.  Heh, I don't even remember the last time I played Commander Keen.

	No matter though.  Got any questions or comments?  Send them to 
flaose@classicgaming.com.  Thanks for reading!

	When will this FAQ be updated again?
	The next time I get bored.
